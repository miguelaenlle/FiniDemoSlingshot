### About the Project
<hr/>

- This project is my submission for the Slingshot Frontend Verification Test. Here, I have designed and developed a new and improved landing page for Fini, a YCombinator S22 batch startup.

- Fini is a startup that aggregates customer support tickets from various data sources (Intercom, Email, Zendesk, etc.), automates their tagging and moving, and provides an analytics dashboard with actionable insights.

- Here is their current landing page: [https://usefini.com/](https://usefini.com/)

- I have redesigned their landing page here at https://fini-demo.web.app/. I also have created a demo video for the redesigned landing page here: https://youtu.be/UmQYoY_Eimc
